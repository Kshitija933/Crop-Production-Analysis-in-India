# Crop-Production-Analysis-in-India
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of crop production trends in India using data analytics and visualization techniques. It aims to uncover insights into agricultural patterns, state-wise productivity, crop-wise yields, and temporal trends to support data-driven decision-making in the agricultural sector.

📌 Project Objectives
Analyze crop production trends across different Indian states.

Identify the most and least productive crops over the years.

Study seasonal patterns and annual variations in yield.

Visualize insights using modern data visualization tools (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly).

Explore the correlation between area cultivated and production.
